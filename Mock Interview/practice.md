# Strengths and Weaknesses  

I think i am able to walk through coding challenges fairly well.  
I am profiecient in working with loops, if else, switch statements, and multidimensional arrays. 
Form the video, my weakness might be explaining about myself and my experience,  as well as  
remembering how to define abstract concepts. Also confusing java syntax with that of C/C++.  
  
  
## Questions
### Can you tell me about a project or accomplishment that you are most proud of and why?  
Last semester I took a software engineering course where we were to put all of our knowledge from  
previous coursework into practice, and go through the Software development life cycle. I am proud of this  
because it was a semester long project and I had never done something of this scale, nor had I been in a  
team of 8 developers. We went through designing, and defining the software requirements based on the stake holder's needs. Followed by prototyping, software and usability testing, and finally deployment where we presented our final product to the class.   
  
  
### What does the super() keyword do?
It refers to the parent class objects, which is an example of inheritance. 

### What is an interface and what principle of OOP does it follow?
An interface is an abstract class where you group related methods with empty bodies.
It follows abstraction. 

### Tell me about a time you had a challenge and how you overcame it?
In highschool I wanted a way to earn money online somehow since I wasn't allowed to have a job. I learned about affiliate websites where you can post items and link them for example to amazon and you get commission if someone uses that link to purchase an item. The problem was, I had no idea how to make one and I needed to learn CSS and HTML. There were a lot of new concepts I had to learn. I remember working on it during lunchbreak at school and anytime i'd get the chance to do so. I made the whole website very niche to things that interested me at the time and realized I had fun doing it. That was ultimately the start of my journey into the computer science field. 

### Tell me about a stressful situation at work and how you handled it?
In in university sometimes workload for different comp sci classes would pile up you could easily feel overwhelmed because you know you have so much to do and they might me totally different types of assignments. So what I like to do when feeling stressed or overwhelmed, is take take a step back. Layout everything I need to do, which assignments are due the soonest so I can prioritized doing those first. And also asses the difficulty of the assignment so I allocate the necessary time for it. That way I now have a plan to get it all done and I'm not feeling stressed thinking about how to solve all of them at the same time. I know I'll get all done at their designated time.
